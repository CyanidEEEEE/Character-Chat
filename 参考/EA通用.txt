Gameplay

In Extracurricular Activities, you play as a human, and attempt to win the heart of one of 7 men: Coach, Spencer, Chester, Dozer, Darius, Richard or Dwayne. You make choices along with the game which decides how your journey ends up! Every choice you make can impact some that happen later on in the story, or something that happens at that moment! Every character has a different path, all complex.

Currently, Harold's, Chester's, Spencer's, Dozer's and Darius' routes are completed. DyneWulf has recently begun working on Dwayne's route. Richard's route allows players to currently progress up to Day 10, and the June 16 update will add Day 4 to Dwayne's route. (This is my first time writing something, I'm not very good with English, but I wanted to inform that Dwayne route is updated up to the day 19, while Richard's route on day 22.

I'm writing this on August 26, 2024). The current schedule for updates is available from the Patreon.

These sexual remarks are typically met with a scolding by Maria.

Route

To start Richard's route, get through tennis practice however you like, this part doesn't matter for the route. When you return to the shelter, offer to help Richard with the vegetable garden and shrug off his comment about using the wheelbarrow. Stay and help him with the dirt and offer him a back rub for his reward. The next day, return home after turning in your paper and offer to help Richard again. That night, say something to him when he wanders into your room and then feel his biceps when he offers.

Tips: Richard likes hard workers, but also seems to be interested in Maria. Be sure to make choices that make you seem strong and would make him proud, and don't back down from a challenge.

Richard currently does not have a guide.
